             <h1>Passion Of Basketball  </h1>


            <p> Basketball has been in my life since the begining. As far as I can remember I always loved the game of basketball. I use to watch the old  people( which is what I used call the older kids ) play. And I was amazed at  what they could do. So   when I was just five years old my mom bought me my very own basketball hoop. And I  would just play on it all day. And I have been hooked on it  every since </p>
